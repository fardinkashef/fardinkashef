## Hi I'm Fardin Kashef
Web development has been my way of turning ideas into reality, ever since I built my first web project, “Funguage”. I was obsessed with the idea of creating an app for language learning through video content, where users could click on subtitle words to access definitions, examples, images, and more. My journey from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the MERN stack and Next.js has been driven by the goal of continuously improving this app.

I am currently seeking a role in MERN stack and Next.js web development. I thrive in collaborative teams where I can receive support and enhance my skills. If you’re hiring, let’s connect!
